A simple Server-to-Client Chat application made in python.
This application uses threads to recieve messages. It works under a Local Area Network. The server uses the IPv4 address of the
computer and port number '5432' (You can use any number greater than 1024).
Instructions to run this program in your computer:
1. Get the pc's IPv4 address in which the server part is running.
2. Copy the address and paste it in the Client part wherever necessary.
  (Note: You are required to add that address in two places(As Described in the comments in the client part) )
3. Once you have added the address, run the server part first and then the client part.
4. Enjoy happy little Chats :)
(Note: This will work under a Local Area Network Address only)
